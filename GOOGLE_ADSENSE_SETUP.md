# 🎯 Google AdSense Auto Ads Setup Guide

## What Are Auto Ads?

**Google AdSense Auto Ads** automatically place ads on your website. Google's machine learning decides:
- Where to place ads
- How many ads to show
- What ad formats to use (banner, native, in-article, etc.)

**You don't need to manually place ad codes** - Google does it all automatically!
